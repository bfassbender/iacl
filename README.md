# IACL - an Imperial Assault Campaign Logger
IACL (Imperial Assault Campaign Logger) will be my try at an campaign logging tool for [Fantasy Flight's Imperial Assault] (https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-imperial-assault).

I'm aiming at two goals here. Firstly to create a simple campaign logger for Imperial Assault campaigns which can grow more sophisticated over time. Secondly to educate myself on building a dynamic web application using Bootstrap and Angular-JS. Maybe later with a small backend for saving campaign stats.
